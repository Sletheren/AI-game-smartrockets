# AI Smart Rockets
A genetic Algorithm implementation to visualize Rockets trying to hit a target and increasing the chances with every generation.
Built using the P5.js library and Javascript. 

## Variables
- You can play around with these variables to increase the effeciency of the program:

### TARGET_RADIUS:
```
The radius of the target circle.
```

### POPULATION_SIZE:
```
The number of rockets in the population, the more the higher the chance of having a maximum fitness.
```

### MUTATION_RATE:
```
Percentage of the mutation to alter the DNA genes.
```

### LIFE_SPAN:
```
Number of iterations to generate a new generation
```
